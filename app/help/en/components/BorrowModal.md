Borrow {debt} from blockchain, by locking up at least {mr} times the value in {collateral} as collateral. If a target collateral ratio (TCR) is set, you need at least TCR times the value (not supported in UI yet).

Collateral and debt levels can be adjusted in any way you desire, as long as your collateral ratio stays above the maintenance collateral ratio of {mr}, or the target collateral ratio if it is set. If your collateral value risks dropping under the maintenance ratio of {mr} by price changes you need to add collateral or reduce debt in order to avoid a margin call.
