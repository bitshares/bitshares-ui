This dialog allows you to set your desired debt and collateral.

If {debt} debt is reduced it will be deducted from {borrower}'s account.
If {debt} debt is increased it will be credited to {borrower} provided there is sufficient {collateral} collateral.   

Collateral may be added or removed so long as the minimal maintenance collateral is maintained.
