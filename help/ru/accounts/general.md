# Accounts

As you may have already noticed by now, this blockchain technology requires you to register an account name. This comes with many advantages: Besides improved scalability, we have separated the identity from the transaction authorizing signature. In practice, *owning an account name* is independent from being able to *spend its funds*. Furthermore, both rights (we call them *permissions*) can split among an arbitrary complex relation of people (we call them *authorities*) using *weights* and a required *thresholds*.
